2019-12-25 I try to learn C&C++ from beginning. But it is much more difficult than Python, just like German to English. 
If I can't make marked progress in C in the next two or three weeks, I will give it up.

2020-01-04 So far I have written about 20 C programs by myself. C might be powerful, but it is lengthy. Life is short,
I mostly focus on Python. Anyway, as a chemist with more than 20 years of expertise,
my knowledge in computer science is mainly rooted in application level.

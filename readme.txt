2019-12-25 I try to learn C&C++ from beginning. But it is much more difficult than Python, just like German to English. 
If I can't make marked progress in C in the next two or three weeks, I will give it up.

2020-01-04 So far I have written about 20 C programs by myself. C might be powerful, but it is lengthy. Life is short,
I mostly focus on Python. Anyway, as a chemist with more than 20 years of expertise,
my knowledge in computer science is mainly rooted in application level.

2020-01-11 I almost finish reading a textbook of C. And I believe I have acquired the ability to read C codes and write
some simple programs, which I think enough for me as a chemist. I will try to apply the computer knowledge that I have
studied in the last three months in the field of chemistry.

2020-03-25 since the beginning of last October, I started to learn Programming language as a tyro. Now I have almost mastered 
the basic skills in coding Python, C and C++. I have written more than 200 programms in total by myself and I believe it will help 
me a lot in solving chemistry problems. In future I will further deepen my knowledge in computer science when I have time, but I
will mainly focus on chemistry from now on.

2020-04-08 I should sincerely acknowlege  the article authors of https://www.csdn.net/, https://github.com/ï¼Œhttps://www.jianshu.com/, https://m.runoob.com/ and more...
They are thanked for their generosity in sharing their knowledge and experience online. Maybe I cannot remember their names, but I have recorded their blog website.
Without the help of their articles, I cannot assimilate the knowledge in the textbook so fast and master the programming skills in short time.
